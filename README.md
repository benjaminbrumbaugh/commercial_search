# 30-day Etsy Contest
### Thank you for joining us on this adventure! We really appreciate your help!

## Intro
```This contest is best efforts, so don't stress it.``` We're trying to reach $1,000 in sales in 30 days with a brand new Etsy store selling 3D prints. There are five amazing groups of friends and family working together with us, each with a wide diversity in interests, lifestyles, ages, and circumstances. We hope to represent that diversity in our catalog. To that end, this is more about what _you like_ than what you think other people will buy. It’s our job to manage the store, you’re helping us find the gems while lending us your unique perspective. With seven 3D printers, one Ben, and one Rose it's going to be an undertaking. But we'll do our best to keep up and adapt.

## How do I find models?
Periodically we'll choose a website that hosts 3D models to help provide focus and help, but you can submit links to models from anywhere. There are some guidelines for printability and respecting the designer's licensing below, but there aren't restrictions regarding free or paid (we'll buy the rights), nor where the models are hosted. The first site will be Printables, see below.


## What makes a good model?
#### You can always just ask!

1. Foremost we want to respect the __licensing__ rights that a designer has chosen for their model. So they need to allow physical prints to be comerically sellable. Most designers will license a model to us even if they are currently listing it without those rights, but that takes time so we may want to just copy those down to persue after the contest. With each site we send out, we'll provide instructions on how to find if a model is licensed for physical sale.

2. Models need to be printable on our __FDM__ printers. This is what you think of when you think of a 3D printer, and it's by far the most common method of 3D printing. If a model page doesn't say what its for, we can assume it's for FDM. The other most common type of model is made for resin printing. These are where you find models with really high detail, like small gaming minitures. We won't have access to resin printers in our print farm, so these are unfortunately out of scope. The other kind of unprintable model you might run accross is models for computer graphics (video games, CGI movies, simulations, architecture). These are usually easily identified by an amazing life-like rendering. These models aren't great because in the computer you can have impossible geometries that don't actually translate into the physical world. Don't stress this too much, it's a bit subtle and you can always just ask me.

3. Models need to be a __single color__ per part. For our print farm each color means an additional print, and they are combined together in the same box. A multicolor model can always be printed in a single color.

4. Each part of a model must fit in __8"x8"x8" Cube__ or __220mm x 220mm x 220mm__. You can have multiple part in a design, and I can also scale them or split them into parts, but it's case-by-case. Selling 10x or 20x of a small thing as one listing is also fair game. Just reach out.

5. Models should __avoid tiny protruding breakable features__. These get into double-trouble. Once when they are being printed, and again when they are being shipped. You find a lot of these in gaming minitures. There is some subtlety in what is robust enough and what isn't, so remember you can always ask :)

6. There are some model categories that are just extremely saturated beyond all reason. One of the largest print farms in the world in China exclusively prints flexy dragons and cute little flexy animals. Fidget toys, planters, and vases are in a similar boat, but some are unusal and interesting. Pretty quickly you're going to begin to notice these, and don't sweat it.

## What colors are available?
Any of the following colors are supported by our print farm: Orange, Red, Green, Yellow, Gold, Blue, Purple, White, Pink and Black. Here is what they all look like:

# Model Repository #1: Printables
### Fun Background
Printables is by the Czech company Original Prusa, an early innovator in the additive manufacting world. Two of the seven printers in the garage are made by Prusa, and they embody a maker's sprit. Open source and modifiable, their printers are meat-and-potatoes no-frills workhorses. Their founder Josef Prusa came from the rep-rap project, an ongoing project to create "humanity's first general-purpose self-replicating manufacturing machine."

# Model Repository #2: Cubee Hive
### Fun Background
Cubee Hive new model hub that is trying to find a way to get designers paid for their work. They are relatively new on the scene, only just breaking 1000 designs, but you can't find most of them anywhere else. Their strategy is a combination of high-quality models made-to-sell, exclusivity through a limited number of sellers, subscription fees for access, and even reocurring royalties to designers. This backpressure gives an advantage to merchants willing to buy-in, and we don't know if it's going to work. However, we're 1 of only 50 accounts that have full site access to all models and marketing materials for all designers. So we intend to find out.

### Helpful Info
This site is new, and it feels like a beta release. My advice is to be patient and find your own rhythm to browsing. The filter tags should be ___avoided___ searching for keywords works pretty well. I noticed it loads better in Firefox than Safari if you're on a computer. If you can only see two pages of models you're probably looking at __Editor's Picks__, __scroll up__. See me for __login__ info.
